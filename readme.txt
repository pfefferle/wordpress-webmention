Enable conversation across the web. When you link to a website you can send it a Webmention to notify it and then that website
may display your post as a comment, like, or other response, and presto, youâ€™re having a conversation from one site to another!

== Description ==

A [Webmention](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/) is a notification that one URL links to another. Sending a Webmention is not limited to blog posts, and can be used for additional kinds of content and responses as well.

For example, a response can be an RSVP to an event, an indication that someone "likes" another post, a "bookmark" of another post, and many others. Webmention enables these interactions to happen across different websites, enabling a distributed social web.

The Webmention plugin supports the Webmention protocol, giving you support for sending and receiving Webmentions. It offers a simple built in presentation.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are Webmentions? =

[Webmention](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/) is a simple way to automatically notify any URL when you link to it on your site. From the receivers perpective, it's a way to request notification when other sites link to it.

= That Sounds Like a Pingback or a Trackback =

Webmention is an update/replacement for Pingback or Trackback. Unlike the older protocols, the specification is recommended by the W3C as well as an active community of individuals using it on their sites.

= How can I send and receive Webmentions? =

On the Settings --> Discussion Page in WordPress:

* On the Webmention Settings page, decide which post types you want to enable Webmentions for. By default, posts and pages.
* Set a page to redirect homepage mentions to. This will automatically enable Webmentions for that page.
* If you want to enable a Webmention form in the comment section, check the box.

You can use the `send_webmention($source, $target)` function and pass a source and a target or you can fire an action like `do_action('send_webmention', $source, $target)`.

= How do I support Webmentions for my custom post type? =

When declaring your custom post type, add post type support for Webmentions by either including it in your `register_post_type` entry. This can also be added in the Webmention settings.

= How do I send/receive Webmentions for attachments? =

You can enable receiving Webmentions for attachments in Webmention settings. You can enable sending Webmentions for media links in the settings. Please note that most receivers of Webmentions do not support receiving them to image, audio, and video files. In order to support receiving them on WordPress, Webmention endpoint headers would have to be added at the webserver level.

= How can I handle Webmentions to my Homepage or Archive Pages? =

Webmentions should be allowed on all URLs of a blog, however WordPress does not support this as only posts can have comments attached to them. The plugin currently handles only Webmentions on posts and allows you to set a page to receive homepage mentions.

Even though it is not done automatically, it is very simple to add support for archives and URLs on your site by providing a post/page to show collect mentions. The plugin provides a simple filter for that.

In the below example, if there is no page returned it will send mentions to a catch-all post. You can also have unique posts per URL.

    function handle_other_webmentions($id, $target) {
      // do nothing if id is set
      if ($id) {
        return $id;
      }

      // return "default" id if plugin can't find a post/page
      return 9247;
    }
    add_filter("webmention_post_id", "handle_other_webmentions", 10, 2);

= Will a caching plugin affect my ability to use this? =

The URL for the Webmention endpoint, which you can view in the source of your pages, should be excluded from any server or plugin caching.

As Webmention uses the REST API endpoint system, most up to date caching plugins should exclude it by default.

= Why does this plugin have settings about avatars? =

Webmentions have the ability to act as rich comments. This includes showing avatars. If there is an avatar discovered, the URL for it will be stored. This can either be reflect something from the media library or a URL of a file. If the file is broken, it will store a local
copy of the default gravatar image.

= There are no Webmention headers on some pages of my site =

Webmention headers are only shown if Webmentions are available for that particular URL. If you want to show it regardless, you can add below to your wp-config.php file.

    define( 'WEBMENTION_ALWAYS_SHOW_HEADERS', 1 );
