-- Video by [Andy Sylvester](http://andysylvester.com/2014/01/27/working-with-webmention-video/)

From the [W3C Recommendation specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/):

> Webmention is a simple way to automatically notify any URL when you link to it on your site.
> From the receivers perpective, it's a way to request notification when other sites link to it.
> It’s a modern alternative to Pingback and other forms of Linkback.

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### What are Webmentions? ###

[Webmention](http://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/) is a simple way to automatically notify any URL when you link to it on your site. From the receivers perpective, it's a way to request notification when other sites link to it.

It’s a modern alternative to Pingback and other forms of Linkback.

### That Sounds Like a Pingback or a Trackback ###

Webmention is an update/replacement for Pingback or Trackback. Unlike the older protocols, the
specification is recommended by the W3C as well as an active community of individuals using
it on their sites.

### How can I send and receive Webmentions? ###

On the Settings --> Discussion Page in WordPress:
* Activate sending Webmentions by checking the "Attempt to notify any blogs linked to from the article" option
* Activate receiving Webmentions by checking the "Allow link notifications from other blogs (pingbacks and trackbacks) on new articles" option.

You can use the `send_webmention($source, $target)` function and pass a source and a target or you can fire an action like `do_action('send_webmention', $source, $target)`.

### How can I handle Webmentions to my Homepage or Archive Pages? ###

Webmentions should be allowed on all URLs of a blog. The plugin currently supports only Webmentions on
posts or pages, but it is very simple to add support for other types like homepages or archive pages.
The easiest way is to provide some kind of a default post/page to show collect all mentions that are not
comments on a post or a page. The plugin provides a simple filter for that:

    function handle_exotic_webmentions($id, $target) {
      // do nothing if id is set
      if ($id) {
        return $id;
      }

      // return "default" id if plugin can't find a post/page
      return 9247;
    }
    add_filter("webmention_post_id", "handle_exotic_webmentions", 10, 2);
