Webmention for WordPress!

## Description ##

[Webmention](http://webmention.net/) is a simple way to notify any URL when you link to it on your site. From the perspective of the receiver, it is a way to request notifications when other sites link to it. 

To further enhance the display of webmentions, we recommend you install [Semantic Linkbacks](http://wordpress.org/plugins/semantic-linkbacks). This optional plugin parses the retrieved content for 
microformats to give better context to webmentions as well as trackbacks and pingbacks.

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### What are Webmentions? ###

[Webmention](http://webmention.net) is a simple way to automatically notify any URL when you link to it on your site. From the receivers perpective, it's a way to request notification when other sites link to it. 

### That Sounds Like a Pingback or a Trackback ###

Webmention is an update/replacement for Pingback or Trackback. Unlike the older protocols, the specification has a working draft with the W3C as well as an active community of individuals using it on their sites.

### How do Webmentions Look on My Site? ###

By default, a webmention will display as 'This was mentioned on Site Title'. We recommend you install [Semantic Linkbacks](http://wordpress.org/plugins/semantic-linkbacks) which has the ability to 
parse the remote content to try and retrieve the author name, author avatar, and improved context, even allowing properly marked up content text to be displayed as a comment to your post. 

### How can I send Webmentions ###

Activate sending Webmentions by checking the "Attempt to notify any blogs linked to from the article" option on the Settings --> Discussion page in WordPress.

You can use the `send_webmention($source, $target)` function and pass a source and a target or you can fire an action like `do_action('send_webmention', $source, $target)`.

### How can I handle Homepage-Webmentions ###

Webmentions should be allowed on all URLs of a blog. The plugin currently supports only Webmentions on
posts or pages, but it offers a way to add support for other types like homepages or archive pages.
You can create a default post/page to show collect all mentions that are not comments on a post or a page. 
The plugin provides a simple filter for that:

    function handle_exotic_webmentions($id, $target) {
      // do nothing if id is set
      if ($id) {
        return $id;
      }

      // return "default" id if plugin can't find a post/page
      return 9247;
    }
    add_filter("webmention_post_id", "handle_exotic_webmentions", 10, 2);

If you want to add a more complex request handler, you should take a look at the
`webmention_request` action and the `synchronous_request_handler`.
