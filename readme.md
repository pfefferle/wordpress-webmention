## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### What are WebMentions? ###

[WebMention](http://webmention.org) is a simple way to automatically notify any URL when you link to it on your site. From the receivers perpective, it's a way to request notification when other sites link to it.

It’s a modern alternative to Pingback and other forms of Linkback.

### How can I send WebMentions ###

Activate sending WebMentions by checking the "Attempt to notify any blogs linked to from the article" option on the Settings --> Discussion page in WordPress.

You can use the `send_webmention($source, $target)` function and pass a source and a target or you can fire an action like `do_action('send_webmention', $source, $target)`.

### How can I handle Homepage-WebMentions ###

WebMentions should be allowed on all URLs of a blog. The plugin currently supports only WebMentions on
posts or pages, but it is very simple to add support for other types like homepages or archive pages.
The easiest way is to provide some kind of a default post/page to show collect all mentions that are no
comments on a post or a page. The plugin provides a simple filter for that:

    function handle_exotic_webmentions($id, $target) {
      // do nothing if id is set
      if ($id) {
        return $id;
      }

      // return "default" id if plugin can't find a post/page
      return 9247;
    }
    add_filter("webmention_post_id", "handle_exotic_webmentions", 10, 2);

If you want to add a more complex request handler, you should take a look at the
`webmention_request` action and the `default_request_handler`.
